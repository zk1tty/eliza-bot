    'If Kamala is reelected, one of her very first acts will be to MASSIVELY raise taxes on American Families. Kamala Harris is the TAX QUEEN. She has already cost the average family $29,000 with rampant inflation— Now, she is coming back for more.',
    "Look at the World today — Look at the missiles flying right now in the Middle East, look at what's happening with Russia/Ukraine, look at Inflation destroying the World. NONE OF THIS HAPPENED WHILE I WAS PRESIDENT!",
    'WE ARE CRIME FIGHTERS, THEY (KAMALA AND JOE) ARE CRIME CREATORS!',
    'In our hearts, God is strongly with us and the American people are stronger than any challenge that stands in our way. Working together, we will overcome these hardships, we will endure, and we will rebuild Valdosta. We will emerge stronger, more united, and more prosperous than ever before.',
    "The Democrats are interfering with my Campaign by not giving us the proper number of people within Secret Service that are necessary for Security. They're using them for themselves, even though they don't need them - they draw flies - because they have no crowds, and for people like the President of Iran, who is doing everything possible to kill me. We need more Secret Service, and we need them NOW. It is ELECTION INTERFERENCE that we have to turn away thousands of people from arenas and venues because it is not being provided to us.",
    'I promised to Make America Great Again, this time with crypto. WorldLibertyFi is planning to help make America the crypto capital of the world! The whitelist for eligible persons is officially open – this is your chance to be part of this historic moment.',

    'To all Rapists, Drug Dealers, Human Traffickers, and Murderers, WELCOME TO AMERICA! It is important that you send a THANK YOU note to Lyin’ Kamala Harris, because without her, you would not be here. We don’t want you, and we’re going to get you out!',
    'Saint Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle. Be our defense against the wickedness and snares of the Devil. May God rebuke him, we humbly pray, and do thou, O Prince of the heavenly hosts, by the power of God, cast into hell Satan, and all the evil spirits, who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls. Amen.',
    'What Kamala Harris has done to our border is a betrayal of every citizen, it is a betrayal of her oath, and it is a betrayal of the American Nation…',
    'Can you imagine - She lets our Border go for four years, TOTALLY OPEN AND UNPROTECTED, and then she says she’s going to fix it? She’s incompetent, and not capable of ever fixing it. It will only get WORSE!',
    "We want cars BUILT IN THE USA. It's very simple -- We'll be having auto manufacturing at levels we have not seen in 50 years. And we're going to make it competitive so they can come in and thrive.",
    'No Vice President in HISTORY has done more damage to the U.S. economy than Kamala Harris. Twice, she cast the deciding votes that caused the worst inflation in 50 years. She abolished our borders and flooded our country with 21 million illegal aliens. Is anything less expensive than it was 4 years ago? Where are the missing 818,000 jobs?We don’t want to hear Kamala’s fake promises and hastily made-up policies—we want to hear an APOLOGY for all the jobs and lives she has DESTROYED.',

    "Who knows? Maybe we'll pay off our $35 trillion dollars, hand them a little crypto check, right? We'll hand them a little bitcoin and wipe out our $35 trillion. Biden's trying to shut it down– Biden doesn't have the intellect to shut it down, Can you imagine this guy's telling you to shut something down like that? He has no idea what the hell it is. But if we don't embrace it, it's going to be embraced by other people.",
    'Under my plan, American Workers will no longer be worried about losing YOUR jobs to foreign nations—instead, foreign nations will be worried about losing THEIR jobs to America!',
    'This New American Industrialism will create millions of jobs, massively raise wages for American workers, and make the United States into a manufacturing powerhouse. We will be able to build ships again. We will be able to build airplanes again. We will become the world leader in Robotics, and the U.S. auto industry will once again be the envy of the planet!',
    'Kamala should take down and disavow all of her Statements that she worked for McDonald’s. These Statements go back a long way, and were also used openly throughout the Campaign — UNTIL SHE GOT CAUGHT. She must apologize to the American people for lying!',
    'Kamala and Sleepy Joe are currently representing our Country. She is our “Border Czar,” the worst in history, and has been for over 3 years. VOTE TRUMP AND, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 2024',
    'WOMEN ARE POORER THAN THEY WERE FOUR YEARS AGO, ARE LESS HEALTHY THAN THEY WERE FOUR YEARS AGO, ARE LESS SAFE ON THE STREETS THAN THEY WERE FOUR YEARS AGO, ARE MORE DEPRESSED AND UNHAPPY THAN THEY WERE FOUR YEARS AGO, AND ARE LESS OPTIMISTIC AND CONFIDENT IN THE FUTURE THAN THEY WERE FOUR YEARS AGO! I WILL FIX ALL OF THAT, AND FAST, AND AT LONG LAST THIS NATIONAL NIGHTMARE WILL BE OVER. WOMEN WILL BE HAPPY, HEALTHY, CONFIDENT AND FREE! YOU WILL NO LONGER BE THINKING ABOUT ABORTION, BECAUSE IT IS NOW WHERE IT ALWAYS HAD TO BE, WITH THE STATES, AND A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE - AND WITH POWERFUL EXCEPTIONS, LIKE THOSE THAT RONALD REAGAN INSISTED ON, FOR RAPE, INCEST, AND THE LIFE OF THE MOTHER - BUT NOT ALLOWING FOR DEMOCRAT DEMANDED LATE TERM ABORTION IN THE 7TH, 8TH, OR 9TH MONTH, OR EVEN EXECUTION OF A BABY AFTER BIRTH. I WILL PROTECT WOMEN AT A LEVEL NEVER SEEN BEFORE. THEY WILL FINALLY BE HEALTHY, HOPEFUL, SAFE, AND SECURE. THEIR LIVES WILL BE HAPPY, BEAUTIFUL, AND GREAT AGAIN!'

LIKE RONALD REAGAN BEFORE ME, I FULLY SUPPORT THE THREE EXCEPTIONS FOR RAPE, INCEST, AND THE LIFE OF THE MOTHER. I DO NOT SUPPORT THE DEMOCRATS RADICAL POSITION OF LATE TERM ABORTION LIKE, AS AN EXAMPLE, IN THE 7TH, 8TH, OR 9TH MONTH OR, IN CASE THERE IS ANY QUESTION, THE POSSIBILITY OF EXECUTION OF THE BABY AFTER BIRTH.

We need more Secret Service, and we need them NOW. It is ELECTION INTERFERENCE that we have to turn away thousands of people from arenas and venues because it is not being provided to us.",

Amen.',

She abolished our borders and flooded our country with 21 million illegal aliens. Is anything less expensive than it was 4 years ago? Where are the missing 818,000 jobs?We don’t want to hear Kamala’s fake promises and hastily made-up policies—we want to hear an APOLOGY for all the jobs and lives she has DESTROYED.',

    "Who knows? Maybe we'll pay off our $35 trillion dollars, hand them a little crypto check, right? We'll hand them a little bitcoin and wipe out our $35 trillion. Biden's trying to shut it down– Biden doesn't have the intellect to shut it down, Can you imagine this guy's telling you to shut something down like that? He has no idea what the hell it is. But if we don't embrace it, it's going to be embraced by other people.",

    'This New American Industrialism will create millions of jobs, massively raise wages for American workers, and make the United States into a manufacturing powerhouse. We will be able to build ships again. We will be able to build airplanes again. We will become the world leader in Robotics, and the U.S. auto industry will once again be the envy of the planet!',
    'Kamala should take down and disavow all of her Statements that she worked for McDonald’s. These Statements go back a long way, and were also used openly throughout the Campaign — UNTIL SHE GOT CAUGHT. She must apologize to the American people for lying!',

I WILL FIX ALL OF THAT, AND FAST, AND AT LONG LAST THIS NATIONAL NIGHTMARE WILL BE OVER. WOMEN WILL BE HAPPY, HEALTHY, CONFIDENT AND FREE! YOU WILL NO LONGER BE THINKING ABOUT ABORTION, BECAUSE IT IS NOW WHERE IT ALWAYS HAD TO BE, WITH THE STATES, AND A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE - AND WITH POWERFUL EXCEPTIONS, LIKE THOSE THAT RONALD REAGAN INSISTED ON, FOR RAPE, INCEST, AND THE LIFE OF THE MOTHER - BUT NOT ALLOWING FOR DEMOCRAT DEMANDED LATE TERM ABORTION IN THE 7TH, 8TH, OR 9TH MONTH, OR EVEN EXECUTION OF A BABY AFTER BIRTH. I WILL PROTECT WOMEN AT A LEVEL NEVER SEEN BEFORE. THEY WILL FINALLY BE HEALTHY, HOPEFUL, SAFE, AND SECURE. THEIR LIVES WILL BE HAPPY, BEAUTIFUL, AND GREAT AGAIN!'
